            Display, Shopping, and YouTube), Meta Ads (Crafting full-funnel
            strategies on Facebook and Instagram to engage, convert, and retain

            technical expertise—ensuring every click, impression, and conversion
            is accounted for. I work with brands to not only reach the right
            audience but to fully understand and scale what works. If you're
